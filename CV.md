## Specialization areas
Below is a high-level breakdown of various areas that I specialize in and related patents/papers/projects.
* **Driver-assistance technology**: Having spent 10+ years in the automotive industry, I have gained deep-rooted knowledge in developing and productionizing various Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Specifically, developing and testing collision mitigation features, such as Forward Collision Alert, Automatic Emergency Braking, Intersection Collision Mitigation, and Pedestrian Collision Mitigation. These features aim to reduce traffic accidents by assisting drivers through necessary alerts and mitigation actions. Less traffic accidents mean less lives lost. My patents and publications in this domain are below.

* **Natural Language Processing**: Being a tri-lingual myself, I see the value and knowledge embedded in every language of the world. I am passionate about enabling knowledge-sharing across different cultures and bringing communities together by overcoming language barriers. While my PhD reserach is currently focused in speech translation, I am well versed in dealing with both texual and speech data. My ongoing projects are below.
